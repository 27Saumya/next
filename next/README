This is a preliminary version of the next compiler made in python.

This is based off earlier versions of the rust programming language.

Source layout:

boot/       The bootstrap compiler
boot/fe     - frontend(lexer, parser, tokenizer)
boot/me     - middle-end(checks)
boot/be     - llvm compiler


rt/         The runtime system

And thats it. Remember this is still in very early development.
